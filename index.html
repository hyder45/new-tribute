    <p>Neymar scored six goals during Santos' run to the 2011 Copa Libertadores Finals, tying him for third top goalscorer,[40] including the clinching goal of Santos' 4–3 aggregate win over Cerro Porteño in the semi-finals.[41] In the two-legged final, Santos faced Uruguayan side Peñarol and drew the first leg 0–0 in Montevideo.[42] At home in the second leg, Neymar opened the scoring in the 46th minute as Santos held on for a 2–1 win and Neymar won Man of the Match honours.[43][44] The win brought Santos their first Copa Libertadores triumph since 1963, when Brazilian legend Pelé was playing for the club.[45][46]</p>
